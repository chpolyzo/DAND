We will be working on the TMDb movie data set which about 10,000 movies
collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). It would be intresting to discover
patterns connecting ratings and revenue patterns in the dataset, however budgeting
information available is very limited. The dataset has Total Rows = 10866 Total Columns = 21 
After Seeing the dataset, we can say that some columns contain missing values and some rows are duplicated
