Here I provide two notebooks necessary for the third project in the Data Analytics Nanodegree, 
along with necessary data to complete the project. Projects for the data analytics nanodegree (aka DAND) 
are elaborated in jupyter notebooks. The mandatory jupyter notrbook for this project is Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb, 
while I also provide another notebook with descriptive statistics namely Descriptive_Statistics_AB_testing.ipynb. 
Data used for this project are also enclosed ab_data.csv and countries.csv. We are using, the last versions of python 3.7, 
pandas, numpy and matplotlib.
